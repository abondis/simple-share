* Simple share

Small bottle app to share files and folders, without all the
complexity of existing alternatives :
- no database to setup
- no webserver to setup
- no syncing
- easier to install and update

Of course it doesn't come with all the features other options offer.

  https://nylas.com/blog/packaging-deploying-python
- [ ] CSRF
- [ ] strip '/\\' from paths
- [ ] UI: sharing URL. figure out how to not have two different urls. For
  now if we do /shared/... to get a file's content, angular tries to
  map it to the $scope.files peut Ãªtre simplement ?download pour les
  url dans files
- [ ] check realpath vs abspath: realpath will follow symlinks ???
